# Overview
This repository contains the R code used for the main analysis presented in the article "Rising cause-specific mortality risk and burden of compound heatwaves amid climate change".
The code is divided into two main parts: (1) Exploration of baseline heatwave-mortality relationships using two-stage time-series methods, and (2) Quantification of future heatwave-related burden under three Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) scenarios.

# Usage
To use these scripts, ensure you have the required datasets and dependencies installed in your Python and R environments.

# Acknowledgments
All the code used here is heavily based on the code used for the analysis in the paper "Mortality risk attributable to high and low ambient temperature: a multi-country study" by Antonio Gasparrini, et al (The Lancet, 2015), and the code used for the analysis in the paper "A hands-on tutorial on a modelling framework for projections of climate change impacts on health" by Vicedo-Cabrera AM, et al (Epidemiology, 2019).
We downloaded their code from here: [https://github.com/gasparrini/2015_gasparrini_Lancet_Rcodedata](https://github.com/gasparrini/2015_gasparrini_Lancet_Rcodedata) and [https://github.com/gasparrini/2019_vicedo-cabrera_Epidem_Rcodedata](https://github.com/gasparrini/2019_vicedo-cabrera_Epidem_Rcodedata) and then edited them as needed for our analysis.
